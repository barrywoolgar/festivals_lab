# Relates to the indentation of if/when/(etc.) blocks when the initial keyword
# is indented as part of a variable assignment.

# Our preference is that the rubocop default conflicts with our 80-character
# line restriction, leaving less space for code inside nested blocks. We make
# this change at the cost of a little bit of readability.

#     # bad (although the Rubocop default):

#               thing!
#             else
#               other_thing!

#     # good (preferred):
#     thing = if x > 42
#       thing!
#     else
#       other_thing!
